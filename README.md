# Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project,The workflow includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization**.

##  Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and visualizations
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Feature scaling (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler)
- Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
- Model training with multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve)
- Visualization of results and feature importance
